Here we adapt popular DNN-based recommender algorithms (offline training and online serving) to online optimization (both online training and serving). 
The most important change is to add exploration mechanism to these algorithms. 
The motivation for this part is from NeuralUCB nad NeuralTS where the DNN-based models can achieve much better performance.
